# Gilded Rose Tech test

## Rules
 - Don't alter the Item class or Item's property
 - You can update the quantity method

## Approach
  - Test first
  - Take it slow, small incremental changes
  - Really understand the code
  - Only clean up tested code

## Targets
  - Take it slow, change minimal amounts
  - Tests always focus on behaviour
  - Leave code better than I found it

## Feedback points
Things I am particularly keen to improve (do give me feedback on any other aspect too)
  - Clarity of commit messages
  - Do you see any steps where I jumped too fast?
  - Keeping my methods short, and responsibilties clear
